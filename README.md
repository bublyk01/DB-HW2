AI query is a simple query, generated by ChatGPT, which shows the amount of money made by each product category in each country during the last 3 months.
My query includes a CTE, which takes all of the orders made during the last 90 days, and 2 covering indexes were added to help with the query execution time (filtered_orders and items_in_orders - names are self-explanatory).
